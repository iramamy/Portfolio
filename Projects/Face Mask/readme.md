# Behind the Mask: Deep Learning for Face Mask Detection

Amidst the challenges posed by COVID-19, enforcing mask-wearing in public spaces became crucial for public health. Recognizing the limitations of manual oversight, I developed a face mask detection model to automate the process. Leveraging supervised learning with 'WithMask' and 'WithoutMask' labels, I expedited the training process using the pretrained 'MobileNet' model. This not only saved significant time and resources but also facilitated seamless integration with a custom sequential model tailored to our specific use case. The resulting model efficiently identifies individuals wearing or not wearing masks, offering a practical solution for authorities to ensure public safety.
