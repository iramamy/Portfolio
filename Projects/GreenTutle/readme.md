# Green Turtle Behavior Classification with 1D VNet

This project implements a 1D VNet architecture in Keras to classify the behaviors of green turtles using acceleration data. It was developed as part of a Deep Learning for Ecology course assignment. 

## Functionality

* This code takes 1D acceleration data from green turtles as input.
* It utilizes a 1D VNet model to classify different turtle behaviors based on the acceleration patterns.
* The model is built using the Keras deep learning library with TensorFlow backend.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* Keras


**Data Source:**

The acceleration data used in this project was provided by our lecturer, Lor√®ne Jeantet. If you wish to reproduce the experiments or explore the data further, please reach out to her for access.


**Evaluation:**

1. The dataset was split into three parts: training, validation, and test. The model's performance was evaluated on the separate test dataset.

2. During model training, the loss and accuracy of the model on the training data were tracked. Below is the plot showing the learning curve of the model during training:

## Future Work

* Explore techniques for data preprocessing and augmentation.
* Experiment with different hyperparameter configurations for the 1D VNet model.
* Integrate the model into a larger ecological analysis pipeline.

**Feel free to reach out with any questions!**
