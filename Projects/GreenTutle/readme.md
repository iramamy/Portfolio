# Green Turtle Behavior Classification with 1D VNet

This project implements a 1D VNet architecture in Keras to classify the behaviors of green turtles using acceleration data. It was developed as part of a Deep Learning for Ecology course assignment. 

## Functionality

* This code takes 1D acceleration data from green turtles as input.
* It utilizes a 1D VNet model to classify different turtle behaviors based on the acceleration patterns.
* The model is built using the Keras deep learning library with TensorFlow backend.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Ensure you have Python (3.x recommended), TensorFlow, and Keras installed.

**Data Source:**

The acceleration data used in this project was provided by our lecturer, Lor√®ne Jeantet. If you wish to reproduce the experiments or explore the data further, please reach out to her for access.


**Evaluation:**

1. Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset.


2. During model training, the loss and accuracy of the model on the training data were tracked. Below is a subplot illustrating the changes in training loss and accuracy over epochs.

## Future Work

* Explore techniques for data preprocessing and augmentation.
* Experiment with different hyperparameter configurations for the 1D VNet model.
* Integrate the model into a larger ecological analysis pipeline.

**Note:** This is a basic implementation for educational purposes. It might require further customization for real-world applications.
