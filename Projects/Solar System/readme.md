# 2D solar system simulation with Numpy and matplotlib

Welcome to a simple yet fascinating program that simulates the orbits of celestial objects around the sun. The simulation currently includes the rotations of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, creating a captivating visualization of their movements in our solar system.

## Features

- **Dynamic Simulation:** Watch as the celestial objects gracefully orbit the sun, demonstrating the beauty of their celestial dance.

- **Expandable:** Feel free to extend the simulation by adding new celestial objects. All the necessary parameters for additional objects can be found [here](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/), allowing you to explore and visualize the orbits of various heavenly bodies.
