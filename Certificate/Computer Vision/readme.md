## Course Modules

### Week 01: Fundamentals of Computer Vision

In the first week, we explored the foundational principles of computer vision, understanding its applications across diverse industries. From enhancing smartphone imagery to aiding medical diagnoses, this module laid the groundwork for the entire course.

### Week 02: Image Processing with OpenCV and Pillow

This module provided hands-on experience with image processing using Python libraries like OpenCV and Pillow. From grasping the basics to applying advanced techniques, this week equipped me with the skills to manipulate and analyze images effectively.

### Week 03: Machine Learning Image Classification

Week 3 focused on machine learning techniques for image classification, covering methods such as k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, softmax regression, and support vector machines. I also delved into creating my image classifier using supervised learning techniques in CV Studio.

### Week 04: Neural Network and Deep Learning for Image Classification

The fourth week introduced me to the world of neural networks and deep learning. I learned about fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and different architectures like ResNet and LeNet. Practical implementations using tools like PyTorch were a highlight.

### Week 05: Object Detection

In the fifth week, I explored various methods of object detection, including Haar Cascade classifiers, R-CNN, and MobileNet. Evaluating the performance of these techniques and comparing results provided a comprehensive understanding of object detection in computer vision.

### Week 06: Project

The culmination of the course involved a hands-on project where I applied my newfound skills to solve a real-world problem, reinforcing the practical aspects of the knowledge gained throughout the program.

## Certificate

This certificate represents not only the successful completion of each module but also a deepened understanding of computer vision and image processingâ€”an essential skill set in today's technology-driven landscape. I am excited to apply these skills to future projects and contribute to the evolving field of visual computing.
